\*\*AI Usage:\*\*

\- Used ChatGPT in designing realistic synthetic weather datasets (CAPE, CIN, Temperature, Pressure) in CSV format to simulate ERA5 output for testing purposes.

\- Used ChatGPT to suggest improved plotting code for better visual presentation (date formatting, axis labels, cleaner legends).

\- Used Anacondaâ€™s built-in AI Assist in the notebook environment to:

&nbsp; - Correct syntax errors.

&nbsp; - Simplify redundant code.

&nbsp; - Improve code clarity for maintainability.

\- All AI-generated code and datasets were manually reviewed, tested, and adjusted for accuracy before inclusion.



\*\*Verification:\*\*

\- Ran `pytest` smoke tests to confirm pipeline outputs met requirements.

\- Verified `features.csv` contained correct columns and data types.

\- Visually inspected `fig\_anomalies.png` to confirm anomaly detection matched expectations.
